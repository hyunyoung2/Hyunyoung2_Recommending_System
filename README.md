# Recommeding_System

## if you get "A B X C D" input string, what it the most possible x ? 

 first, what is the most possible a word behind A B ?
 
 second, what is the most possible a word before C D ?
 
 third, if you combine two thing above, then what is the most possible X 
 
 in this case, I will base on nGram, from bigram to five gram.
